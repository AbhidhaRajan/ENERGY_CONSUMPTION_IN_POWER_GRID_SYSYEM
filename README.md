## Problem Statement:
This project aims to develop a time series forecasting model for predicting energy consumption
patterns in smart grid systems. By leveraging historical data on energy usage, weather
conditions, holidays, and other relevant factors, the model seeks to forecast future energy
consumption accurately. The goal is to optimize energy distribution and resource allocation,
enabling efficient management of electricity grids. By forecasting energy consumption patterns,
this project contributes to reducing costs, improving grid reliability, and promoting sustainability in
energy management.

## Methodology:

1.Data Collection: Gather historical energy consumption data from power grid systems.

2.Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and convert timestamps to a standard format,Outlier Detection and Treatment.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering: Analyze patterns, trends, and correlations in energy consumption data and add other columns from existing columns,Encoding and Feature Scaling/Normalization.

Encoding is the process of converting categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. Feature scaling/normalization is the technique of adjusting the range of numerical features to ensure they have similar scales, preventing certain features from dominating others and improving the performance of many machine learning algorithms.

4.Model Development: Selecting best features for model development.Develop predictive models (e.g., time series forecasting models like ARIMA, machine learning algorithms like SVR to forecast future energy consumption.
SelectKBest is a feature selection method in machine learning used to select the most important features from a dataset based on statistical tests like chi-squared. It scores each feature individually and selects the k highest-scoring features, which can help improve model performance and reduce dimensionality.

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a time series forecasting method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and its lagged values, integrating differencing to achieve stationarity.
SVR (Support Vector Regression) is a supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks, aiming to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between data points and the regression line in a higher-dimensional space defined by kernel functions. RandomForest and GBR stand for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regression, respectively.


5.Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using validation techniques and metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

       Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average absolute difference between predicted values and actual values, providing a straightforward indication of model accuracy. Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values, giving higher weight to large errors and often used in optimization algorithms. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of MSE, offering a measure in the same units as the original data, which makes it easier to interpret, and is particularly useful for comparing models with different units or scales.

6.Model Deployment: Predicting energy consumption for the test dataset and saving the model

7.Documentation and Reporting: Documenting the entire process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, model selection, and evaluation Preparing a comprehensive report summarizing project findings, insights, and recommendations Communicating the results effectively to stakeholders, including non-technical audiences
