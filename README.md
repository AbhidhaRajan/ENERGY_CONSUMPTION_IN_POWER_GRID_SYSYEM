# ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_IN_POWER_GRID_SYSYEM

## Problem Statement:
This project aims to develop a time series forecasting model for predicting energy consumption
patterns in smart grid systems. By leveraging historical data on energy usage, weather
conditions, holidays, and other relevant factors, the model seeks to forecast future energy
consumption accurately. The goal is to optimize energy distribution and resource allocation,
enabling efficient management of electricity grids. By forecasting energy consumption patterns,
this project contributes to reducing costs, improving grid reliability, and promoting sustainability in
energy management.

## Methodology:

1.Data Collection: Gather historical energy consumption data from power grid systems.

2.Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and convert timestamps to a standard format,Outlier Detection and Treatment.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering: Analyze patterns, trends, and correlations in energy consumption data and add other columns from existing columns,Encoding and Feature Scaling/Normalization.

4.Model Development: Selecting best features for model development.Develop predictive models (e.g., time series forecasting models like ARIMA, machine learning algorithms like SVR) to forecast future energy consumption.

5.Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using validation techniques and metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

6.Model Deployment: Predicting energy consumption for the test dataset and saving the model

7.Documentation and Reporting: Documenting the entire process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, model selection, and evaluation Preparing a comprehensive report summarizing project findings, insights, and recommendations Communicating the results effectively to stakeholders, including non-technical audiences
